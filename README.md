Metafuck
========

Metafuck is a compiler that translates an awesome programming language to Brainfuck and it also includes an interpreter that runs the generated code.

How to compile
--------------

Metafuck compiles lovely with Visual C++ (not that we love that compiler but we like the IDE). It _should_ also compile with other compilers.

Boost is required by Metafuck (i.e. for the command line options), so you should get that first if you don't already have it installed.
